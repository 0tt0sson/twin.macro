# TypeScript

Because Twin can be coupled with different css-in-js libraries, the types for `styled` and `css` aren't built-in.

Follow these instructions to add support for the types:

- [Setup Emotion + TypeScript](emotion/typescript.md)
- [Setup Styled components + TypeScript](styled-components/typescript.md)
